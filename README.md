# Game-Based Learning for Maths

## Games in Progress

[Algebots](https://ghclark2.github.io/AlgebotsPublic/) will ultimately become a platform based game where the enemies are algebraic problems and are defeated by using a variety of weapons to shoot and manipulate them (because who hasn't at some point wanted to obliterate algebra!). It is built on the Phaser 3 engine and the work to date has primarily been on:
- setting up a streamlined way to take an algebraic expression and automatically convert it into an algebot that can be manipulated in the game, 
- correctly rendering the algebot enemies, 
- coding how the various weapons work in the background and
- considering how progression of difficulty of enemies and acquisition of different weapons will work from a teaching and gameplay perspective.

Next stages will involve: 
- animating enemies,
- creating some sample levels

[SpaceGrad](https://ghclark2.github.io/SpaceGradPublic/) is one level of a game to teach graphing skills, in this case how to recognise gradients. The objective is to click on the correct gradient for the yellow path to the next waypoint. Incorrect clicks cause your spaceship to slow down, but if you get enough correct gradients in a row, you can use spacebar to boost your speed. Scoring is then based on your speed through the level and number of errors. Pedagogically, the first half of the level aims to acquaint you with a new set of gradients and then these are randomly mixed up in the second half to prevent students just learning the position to click rather than the actual value.

This was my test project whilst learning Phaser 3, before I shifted my focus back to the Phaser 3 version of my Algebots game above. I have plans for a whole assortment of other levels that would combine with this one to teach most concepts required for linear graphing.
