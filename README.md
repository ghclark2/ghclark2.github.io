# Game-Based Learning for Maths

## Games in Progress

[Algebots2](https://ghclark2.github.io/algebots2Public/) is a work in progress, which will ultimately become a platform based game where the enemies are algebraic problems and are defeated by using a variety of weapons to shoot and manipulate them (because who hasn't at some point wanted to obliterate algebra!). It is built on the Phaser 3 engine and the work to date has primarily been on:
- setting up a streamlined way to take an algebraic expression and automatically convert it into an algebot that can be manipulated in the game, 
- correctly rendering the algebot enemies, 
- coding how the various weapons work in the background and
- considering how progression of difficulty of enemies and acquisition of different weapons will work from a teaching and gameplay perspective.

Next stages will involve: 
- animating enemies,
- creating some sample levels
